PerformedChart Issues:
	Additional FootSwap tightening
	Choosing odd NewArrow NewArrow jumps that involve a swap. e.g. UD to DR with left moving from U to D.

Document new bracket parsing config.

Charts with Bugs?
	Involve expressed chart costs:
		Oh! (measure 44)
			chose a bracket over a jump. this results in a really ambiguous pattern on dp
		Hold it against me (measyure 42)
			tricky. could go either way. goes against norm for hold indication of oduble step.
			lots of little problems because of the holds
		Technical Showcase 4\Get Your Wish (DJ NOT PORTER ROBINSON Remix)
			This is extremely complicated with lots of swaps into brackets and intentional double stepping.

Tests:
	SM/SSC Reader unit Tests
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable

Misc:
	Document how it works.
	Load arrowdata from json so we can easily add piu charts without recompiling
	public / private pass
	comment / cost cleanup
	Some way to preserve formatting / ordering / comments / etc better when loading and saving sm/ssc chart.
	Copy song pack files (pack art)
	if all 4 notes are full in sp and there is at least one mine, add mines so it is a whole row of mines in dp? or at least, 4 mines = 8 mines?
	Preserving patters
	time remaining on export?

Renderer Improvements:
	css to minimize log size
	Render note count distribution.
	Render Fakes and Lifts differently.
	Render negative Stops (fakes) differently.
	Fix the terrible orange and pink circle graphics.
	Render performed chart starting position.
	Render when the performed chart uses different StepTypes.
