Immediate Bugs:
	Figure out which chart is causing the error writing note data. It is either a bad lane, or a bad (non 4/4) position.

PerformedChart Issues:
	Test Charts:
		more than friends
		love bug yuce

	X NPS balance: Need to record average NPS and peak NPS stats so we know what numbers to use for balancing
	X Add a cost for individual steps which move quickly over a certain bpm
	X Add a cost for the body moving quickly over a series of steps if this quick move is a "burst" (nps)

	Additional FootSwap tightening

	Unclear Footing Problem:
		Add something to graphlink for a jump when it us an ambiguous jump?
		Add a new StepType AmbiguousNewArrow?
			On a NewArrow NewArrow jump we might choose NewArrow FootSwap - feels bad
				e.g. on DP from R on P2D, L on P2U a NewArrow NewArrow jump went to L on P1R, R on P2U. P2U is a swap and this looks wrong.
	Choosing Bad Patterns
		On a NewArrow NewArrow jump we might choose NewArrow FootSwap - feels bad
				e.g. on DP from R on P2D, L on P2U a NewArrow NewArrow jump went to L on P1R, R on P2U. P2U is a swap and this looks wrong.
			Maybe:
				Don't choose patterns that wouldn't be expressed the same way.
					This gets pretty difficult (need to be able to parse a DP pattern)

Tests:
	SM/SSC Reader unit Tests
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?
	Bracket H New T New can pick up

Misc:
	Some way to preserve formatting / ordering / comments / etc better when loading and saving sm/ssc chart.
	Copy song pack files (pack art)
	Load arrowdata from json so we can easily add piu charts without recompiling
	if all 4 notes are full in sp and there is at least one mine, add mines so it is a whole row of mines in dp? or at least, 4 mines = 8 mines?
	Preserving patters
	time remaining on export?

Renderer Improvements:
	css to minimize log size
	Render note count distribution.
	Render Fakes and Lifts differently.
	Render negative Stops (fakes) differently.
	Fix the terrible orange and pink circle graphics.
	Render performed chart starting position.
	Render when the performed chart uses different StepTypes.
