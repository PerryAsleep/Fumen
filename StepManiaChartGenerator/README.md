# StepManiaChartGenerator
`StepManiaChartGenerator` is an application for converting [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/) charts into other StepMania charts that maintain the qualities of the original charts and feel natural. The primary use case is converting singles charts into doubles charts.

The application understands most technical moves including crossovers, inverted steps (a.k.a Afronova walks), footswaps, and brackets.

## Examples
See the [Examples](docs/Examples.md) page for visualizations of how charts are converted and some videos of generated doubles charts being played.
