Before release:
	final version number?

Charts with Bugs:
	Expressed Chart bugs:
		Oh! (measure 44)
			chose a bracket over a jump. this results in a really ambiguous pattern on dp
		Hold it against me (measyure 42)
			tricky. could go either way. goes against norm for hold indication of oduble step.
			lots of little problems because of the holds
		Technical Showcase 4\Get Your Wish (DJ NOT PORTER ROBINSON Remix)
			This is extremely complicated with lots of swaps into brackets and intentional double stepping.
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Twilight (pas lam) (ECFA 6 H S 3)
			swpas into brackets which are interpreted as jacks into jump
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable
		HoodStar Challenge from Enjoy Stamina:
			In charts with double steps, the expression will prefer a swap with long inverted patterns to avoid the double step.

Misc:
	ExpressedChart should also search through other tiers of roots.
	Additional FootSwap tightening?
	Should a swap be a distinct move in a jump? (NewArrow NewArrow that involves a swap)
	Copy song pack files (pack art)
	if all 4 notes are full in sp and there is at least one mine, add mines so it is a whole row of mines in dp? or at least, 4 mines = 8 mines?
	Annoying that the tightening bpm cutoff doesn't include the bounds.
	Some way to preserve formatting / ordering / comments / etc better when loading and saving sm/ssc chart.

Visualization Improvements:
	Render Fakes and Lifts differently.
	Render negative Stops (fakes) differently.
	Render performed chart starting position.
	Render when the performed chart uses different StepTypes.
