Additions:
	Afronova walk
	Bracket that is also a foot swap
	do something to address that the patterns stay on one side of the pads too much.

	Unit test simple patterns and expressions to ensure tweaks to costs doesn't fuck up charts.

Bugs:
	(likely fixed) hey sexy lady - somehow doubles lost some mines?
	hey sexy lady - going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
	giga violate - two crossover in fronts in a row resulting in a spin at measure 33 4
	X giga violate sp 68, 3, 0/0: wrong choice
	X giga violate performed chart 17, 1, 3/4 - WHAT THE FUCK
	X giga violate - lost a note - looks like a mine replaced it? measure 32.
	giga violate sp 14, 0: should be a bracket AND a foot swap and NOT a jump.
	giga violate - sp beginner chart straight up lost a measure??? I have no idea how this would happen.
	X performed chart can put a tap at the same time a hold ends for the same arrow
		occurs if the step is a jump on same arrow / same arrow and the previous step was a bracket with at least one held
		the arrow(s) release and then at the same time it chooses a new arrow and that could be one of the other releases
		possible solutions:
			1) when generating the performed chart, on each node, do a check

	sm reader strips spaces out of some text like "Chief Skittles"
	exporting giga violate twice somehow lost the bpm? (or stepmania nuked it)




how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

Way to express preference
	e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524





does the stepgraph support a pattern like:
...X
.X..
X...
..XX
crossover into bonkers jump

look at Hella Deep in Technical Showcase 4 - crazy bpm stuff
	scc file
	B - background change
	#SCROLLS
	#SPEEDS
NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
