Possible Bugs:
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?
	Currently, JumpBothSame after a FootSwap will cause both feet to jump on the same arrow.
		Not true. This jump will fail to be made since each foot's other foot is resting on the arrow. 

Tests:
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Misc Bugs:
		sm reader strips spaces out of some text like "Chief Skittles"
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Giga Violate:
			14, Should be a bracket AND a foot swap and NOT a jump.
			exporting giga violate twice somehow lost the bpm? (or stepmania nuked it)

Misc:
	SSC file parsing / saving
	Write some code to export lines of code that can be used to unit test the expression.
		This way you can easily make tests for entire charts.

PerformedChart improvements:
	Do something to address that the patterns stay on one side of the pads too much.
	Prefer swaps that don't make you move so much.
	Going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
	Preference for closer steps?
		e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524

Perf:
	StepGraph generation:
		I wonder if rolling is needed in StepGraph generation...
		Save/Load?





how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

look at Hella Deep in Technical Showcase 4 - crazy bpm stuff
	scc file
	B - background change
	#SCROLLS
	#SPEEDS
NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
