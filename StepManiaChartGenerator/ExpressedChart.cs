	/// An ExpressedChart is a series of events which describe the intent of a chart.
	/// Instead of specifying the specific arrows or mines in a chart is specifies
	/// the types of steps and mines that make it up.
	/// For example, instead of events like tap on P1L, tap on P1D, tap on P1R an
	/// ExpressedChart would represent that as a step with the left foot on the same arrow,
	/// a step with the right foot on a different arrow, and a crossover in front with
	/// the left foot to a new arrow.
	/// An ExpressedChart's representation comes from GraphLinks, which specify FootActions
	/// and StepTypes for each foot.
	/// Creating an ExpressedChart allows for converting the chart from one set of arrows
	/// like 4-panel to a different set like 8-panel. An equivalent 4-panel and 8-panel
	/// chart would share the same ExpressedChart, though their specific PerformedCharts
	/// would be different.
	/// Given a graph of StepNodes for set of arrows and an ExpressedChart, a PerformedChart
	/// can be generated.
