What makes a chart good:
	Moving to the left or the right 'frequently'
	left and right don't mean 1 and 7, but both feet on 1-4 and both feet on 5-8
		when to move l and r seems to be a function not only of number of notes, but also the speed of the notes
			typical to move more when the notes are slower (eighths)

		we can look ahead and know, how many arrows should we spend on the current side.
			then, perhaps it is a search for routes which put you there?

	distribution

PerformedChart improvements:
	Move to other side more
		maybe parse a bunch of good charts, find what a good distribution looks like and try to match that.
		Every N (~20-50?) steps, look at the last N
			choose the chunk with the best distribution 

		Local min problem

		Need charts that are balanced (they look like the bell curve)
			and also move side to side often

	Preference:
		Swaps that don't make you move so much (e.g. got a swap that is P1D, P2L, P2L, P2R (OOF))
		Preference for closer steps (e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524)

	Choosing bad patterns:
		Going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
		On a NewArrow NewArrow jump we might choose NewArrow FootSwap - feels bad
			e.g. on DP from R on P2D, L on P2U a NewArrow NewArrow jump went to L on P1R, R on P2U. P2U is a swap and this looks wrong.
		Maybe:
			Don't choose patterns that wouldn't be expressed the same way.
				This gets pretty difficult (need to be able to parse a DP pattern)

Possible Bugs:
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?

Tests:
	SM/SSC Reader unit Tests
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable

Misc:
	Some way to preserve formatting / ordering / comments / etc better when loading and saving sm/ssc chart.

Renderer Improvements:
	Render Fakes and Lifts differently.
	Render negative Stops (fakes) differently.
	Fix the terrible orange and pink circle graphics.
	Render performed chart starting position.
	Render when the performed chart uses different StepTypes.

Perf:
	StepGraph generation:
		Multithreaded StepGraph internals?
		Save/Load?





how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
