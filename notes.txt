Additions:
	Need
		BracketOneSwapOneSame
		BracketOneSwapOneNew

PerformedChart improvements:
	Do something to address that the patterns stay on one side of the pads too much.
	Prefer swaps that don't make you move so much.
	Going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.

Misc:
	Script to copy from stepmania to source repo.

Pref:
	StepGraph generation:
		I wonder if rolling is needed in StepGraph generation...
		Save/Load?


Possible Bugs:
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?
	Currently, JumpBothSame after a FootSwap will cause both feet to jump on the same arrow.
		Not true. This jump will fail to be made since each foot's other foot is resting on the arrow. 


Tests:
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Don't You Want Me:
		X 11: bracketed a step during a hold (8) instead of tapping with R (3) - no idea (does this a few times)
		18: missed a foot swap, but the path it chose was reasonable
		20: pretty wild jump (crossed over into non crossed over, both new arrows) because missed a swap
			the jump should be weighted higher
			measure 52 as well
		45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
	Giga Violate:
		14, Should be a bracket AND a foot swap and NOT a jump.

	Hey Sexy Lady:
		(likely fixed) Somehow doubles lost some mines?

	sm reader strips spaces out of some text like "Chief Skittles"
	exporting giga violate twice somehow lost the bpm? (or stepmania nuked it)




how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

Way to express preference
	e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524





does the stepgraph support a pattern like:
...X
.X..
X...
..XX
crossover into bonkers jump

look at Hella Deep in Technical Showcase 4 - crazy bpm stuff
	scc file
	B - background change
	#SCROLLS
	#SPEEDS
NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
