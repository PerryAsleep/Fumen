Additions:
	Bracket that is also a foot swap
	Jump that is also a foot swap (LU -> RU)

	Afronova walk
		note that this should be more expensive than a foot swap.
	do something to address that the patterns stay on one side of the pads too much.

Possible Bugs:
	Footswap into jump both same / jump one same
		Add a Lifted state.
		Clean up existing "lifted" comment terminology

Tests:
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	(likely fixed) hey sexy lady - somehow doubles lost some mines?
	hey sexy lady - going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
	X giga violate - two crossover in fronts in a row resulting in a spin at measure 33 4
	X giga violate sp 68, 3, 0/0: wrong choice
	X giga violate performed chart 17, 1, 3/4 - WHAT THE FUCK
	X giga violate - lost a note - looks like a mine replaced it? measure 32.
	giga violate sp 14, 0: should be a bracket AND a foot swap and NOT a jump.
	giga violate - sp beginner chart straight up lost a measure??? I have no idea how this would happen.
	X performed chart can put a tap at the same time a hold ends for the same arrow

	sm reader strips spaces out of some text like "Chief Skittles"
	exporting giga violate twice somehow lost the bpm? (or stepmania nuked it)




how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

Way to express preference
	e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524





does the stepgraph support a pattern like:
...X
.X..
X...
..XX
crossover into bonkers jump

look at Hella Deep in Technical Showcase 4 - crazy bpm stuff
	scc file
	B - background change
	#SCROLLS
	#SPEEDS
NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
