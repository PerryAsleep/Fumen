PerformedChart Issues:
	Test Charts:
		more than friends
		love bug yuce

	Additional FootSwap tightening

	Unclear Footing Problem:
		It would be best to keep ambiguous footing if the original chart had it.
		But it is still an improvement to never choose ambiguous steps.

		Ambiguity cannot be represented in the stepgraph since it depends on which steps preceded it.
			For example home position to down is only ambiguous after a jump. It is not ambiguous after a step (you alternate).

Charts with Bugs?
	Technical Showcase 4\Get Your Wish (DJ NOT PORTER ROBINSON Remix)
		This is extremely complicated with lots of swaps into brackets and intentional double stepping.
	Skittles Selection 8\GIGA VIOLATE (10): measure 67
		Not terrible. Interprets jump as bracket, and that can result in spread in the performed chart.

Tests:
	SM/SSC Reader unit Tests
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?
	Bracket H New T New can pick up

Misc:
	Some way to preserve formatting / ordering / comments / etc better when loading and saving sm/ssc chart.
	Copy song pack files (pack art)
	Load arrowdata from json so we can easily add piu charts without recompiling
	if all 4 notes are full in sp and there is at least one mine, add mines so it is a whole row of mines in dp? or at least, 4 mines = 8 mines?
	Preserving patters
	time remaining on export?

Renderer Improvements:
	css to minimize log size
	Render note count distribution.
	Render Fakes and Lifts differently.
	Render negative Stops (fakes) differently.
	Fix the terrible orange and pink circle graphics.
	Render performed chart starting position.
	Render when the performed chart uses different StepTypes.
