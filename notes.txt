Hold / Roll issue:
	Problem:
		For a bracket that is a short roll and long hold, we don't have a way in the StepGraph of distinguishing
		that from a long roll and short hold. For example a bracket on SameArrow SameArrow with Hold and Roll. Could be either.
	
	Solution 1:
		For brackets, make index 0 heel and index 1 toe.
		When releasing we need to differentiate releasing the heel versus releasing the toe.
		That way a bracket in the expressed chart would be:
			pos 1: hold heel and roll toe
			pos 2: release toe
			pos 2: release heel
	
		StepGraph:
			SameArrow,
			NewArrow,
			CrossoverFront,
			CrossoverBehind,
			InvertFront,
			InvertBehind,
			FootSwap,

			BracketBothNew,
			BracketHeelNew,
			BracketToeNew,
			BracketBothSame

			BracketHeelSameArrow (for release and tap)
			BracketHeelNewArrow
			BracketToeSameArrow (for release and tap)
			BracketToeNewArrow

		Expressed chart:
			when encountering a hold or roll, we need to store on that arrow what foot and what part of the foot hit it (e.g. Left Toe)
			this way when the release follows, we can look up what type of release (Toe v Heel) it is.

				We actually don't need to do this ^. the graph will choose the right one for us since only one (heel or toe) will match.

			So, how do you look up if it is a heel or toe in the first place?
			The problem is, in the StepGraph one GraphLink maps to many GraphNodes
			There is no data that says When GraphLink A maps to GraphNode B  HOW does it map. In other words, which arrow is the heel and which is the foot?
			Actually maybe that isn't true.
			If we stop sorting the GraphNode State and instead have the indicies match the Link (0:heel, 1:toe) then we know heel / toe arrows
			We still don't know the actual arrow though. Actually we do.

			This also doesnt prevent us from getting rid of Rolls and attaching Rolls as Instance data.

		Performed chart:
			This should just work since the links know if they are release on BracketHeelSameArrow or BracketToeSameArrow

	Solution 2:
		Attach some stateful data to the link when generating the ExpressedChart.


Additions:
	Need
		BracketToeSwapHeelSame
		BracketToeSwapHeelNew
		BracketHeelSwapHeelSame
		BracketHeelSwapToeNew

Possible Bugs:
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?
	Currently, JumpBothSame after a FootSwap will cause both feet to jump on the same arrow.
		Not true. This jump will fail to be made since each foot's other foot is resting on the arrow. 

Tests:
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Misc Bugs:
		sm reader strips spaces out of some text like "Chief Skittles"
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Giga Violate:
			14, Should be a bracket AND a foot swap and NOT a jump.
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable


Misc:
	SSC file parsing / saving
	Write some code to export lines of code that can be used to unit test the expression.
		This way you can easily make tests for entire charts.

PerformedChart improvements:
	Do something to address that the patterns stay on one side of the pads too much.
	Prefer swaps that don't make you move so much.
	Going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
	Preference for closer steps?
		e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524

Perf:
	StepGraph generation:
		Remove the loops over currentIndex and newIndex. This is a holdover from when the state representation was
			every arrow instead of the two arrows for each foot. We don't need to loop and can instead just check the current state's current arrows.
		X Remove Rolls
		AggressiveInlining
		Save/Load?





how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

look at Hella Deep in Technical Showcase 4 - crazy bpm stuff
	scc file
	B - background change
	#SCROLLS
	#SPEEDS
NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
