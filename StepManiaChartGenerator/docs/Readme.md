# StepManiaChartGenerator

`StepManiaChartGenerator` is an application for converting [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/) charts into other types of StepMania charts that maintain the qualities of the original charts and feel natural.

It understands most technical moves including crossovers, inverted steps (a.k.a Afronova walks), footswaps, brackets, and stretch, and it offers fine controls for tuning generated charts.

## Examples
