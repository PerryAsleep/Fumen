how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

Way to express preference
	e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524


Logic:
	X initialize dp arrow data
	X initialize dp graph

	X load sp chart
	X convert sp chart to expressed chart

	X search for a path through the dp graph that matches the expressed chart
	X put the mines in
	X convert the path to a dp chart
	X put all the tempo changes, stops in

does the stepgraph support a pattern like:
...X
.X..
X...
..XX
crossover into bonkers jump

look at Hella Deep in Technical Showcase 4 - crazy bpm stuff
	scc file
	B - background change
	#SCROLLS
	#SPEEDS
NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
