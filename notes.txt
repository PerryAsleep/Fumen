Im a maid.sm - sharpnel. error parsing notes.
limit html logs somehow? maybe not

PerformedChart improvements:
	Faster patterns should move less.
		See: more than friends
	Swaps should move less, especially if fast.
	Need to fix jumps into unclear footing.
	On a NewArrow NewArrow jump we might choose NewArrow FootSwap - feels bad
		e.g. on DP from R on P2D, L on P2U a NewArrow NewArrow jump went to L on P1R, R on P2U. P2U is a swap and this looks wrong.
	Come & Get It: Did not understand roll was part of stream? Somehow ended up with crossovers which felt bad.

	Move to other side more frequently
		Take into account density to swap sides at low density areas?
		Take into account current step in cost?
			what arrow is it on, and also where did it come from.
				or maybe, track where your body is centered over time and look for a big move?

	Preference:
		Swaps that don't make you move so much (e.g. got a swap that is P1D, P2L, P2L, P2R (OOF))
		Preference for closer steps (e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524)

	Choosing bad patterns:
		Going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
		On a NewArrow NewArrow jump we might choose NewArrow FootSwap - feels bad
			e.g. on DP from R on P2D, L on P2U a NewArrow NewArrow jump went to L on P1R, R on P2U. P2U is a swap and this looks wrong.
		Maybe:
			Don't choose patterns that wouldn't be expressed the same way.
				This gets pretty difficult (need to be able to parse a DP pattern)

Possible Bugs:
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?

Tests:
	SM/SSC Reader unit Tests
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable

Misc:
	Some way to preserve formatting / ordering / comments / etc better when loading and saving sm/ssc chart.
	Copy song pack files (pack art)

Renderer Improvements:
	Render note count distribution.
	Render Fakes and Lifts differently.
	Render negative Stops (fakes) differently.
	Fix the terrible orange and pink circle graphics.
	Render performed chart starting position.
	Render when the performed chart uses different StepTypes.





how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
