	/// This class isn't strictly necessary but it is helpful for a few reasons:
	///  1) Mines are associated with neighboring steps or releases. ExpressedCharts and
	///     PerformedCharts don't have a simple way to report what is a step and what is
	///     a release. This class keeps that logic in one spot so that these classes can
	///     stay in sync. See GetReleasesAndSteps.
	///  2) Similarly, logic for what constitutes the Nth most recent arrow (chiefly, that
	///     arrows at the same position share the same N) was duplicated in ExpressedChart
	///     and now PerformedChart. This class keeps that logic in one spot.
	///  3) Mine logic was causing legibility issues when integrated into ExpressedChart
	///     and PerformedChart. By moving that logic here those classes focus more on just
	///     steps.
