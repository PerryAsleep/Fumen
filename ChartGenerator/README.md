# ChartGenerator
`ChartGenerator` is an application for converting [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/) charts into other StepMania charts that maintain the qualities of the original charts and feel natural. The primary use case is converting singles charts into doubles charts.

The application understands most technical moves including crossovers, inverted steps (a.k.a Afronova walks), foot swaps, and brackets.
