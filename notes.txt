Possible Bugs:
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?
	Currently, JumpBothSame after a FootSwap will cause both feet to jump on the same arrow.
		Not true. This jump will fail to be made since each foot's other foot is resting on the arrow. 

Tests:
	SM/SSC Reader unit Tests

	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Misc Bugs:
		PerformedChart needs to try alternate starting positions if it can't find a path
			vivid landscape landscape_revised is an example which fails to find a path.
			Perhaps just do some new arrow steps from the root?
	Chart Bugs:

		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable

Misc:
	Some way to preserve formatting / ordering / comments / etc better when loading and saving sm/ssc chart.
	Fakes and Lifts.
		For You has fakes.
		Fakes are probably just a normal note with an extra piece of data on them so we can write them back out as an F.
		Actually, maybe the same for lifts?
	Options so the user can specify which types of steps are okay to replace with which other types (brackets)

PerformedChart improvements:
	Preference:
		Swaps that don't make you move so much (e.g. got a swap that is P1D, P2L, P2L, P2R (OOF))
		Preference for closer steps (e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524)
		Move to other side more
			maybe parse a bunch of good charts, find what a good distribution looks like and try to match that.
	Choosing bad patterns:
		Going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
		On a NewArrow NewArrow jump we might choose NewArrow FootSwap - feels bad
			e.g. on DP from R on P2D, L on P2U a NewArrow NewArrow jump went to L on P1R, R on P2U. P2U is a swap and this looks wrong.
		Maybe:
			Don't choose patterns that wouldn't be expressed the same way.
				This gets pretty difficult (need to be able to parse a DP pattern)

Perf:
	StepGraph generation:
		Multithreaded StepGraph internals?
		Save/Load?





how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
