Immediates:
	X Missing some bracket links:
		For example (L) going from LD to LU
			technically this is heel new toe new
			we wont fill this because of the IsFree check.
				this check could maybe be changed to IsOtherFootNotOnThisArrow since we know:
					we will always choose 2 different arrows for a bracket fill
					we know that all of the 'current' state arrows for this foot will be updated
			problem: ignore if your foot is on this arrow means that you might fill heel new toe same with a combo that is actually same same
				might need to check: if there is only one portion on an arrow (default), then it really does need to be new,
				if there are two portions on arrows then it is okay if it is occupied by the other portion
	X If you foot swap and replace a foot, should that foot actually go invalid on other arrows?
		if it is resting on another arrow it might make sense to keep that
			and possibly go invalid on the arrow it was swapped on?

	X Write test for the new test chart for Giga Violate
	X Put in real cost
		X 14: Bracket and Swap works
		X 46: Swaps when should not
		X 68: Still not swapping when should. Hold determination wrong? (stepgraph was wrong due to typo)
		X 44: Should this be a bracket or a jump? I think a jump since it would be a double step on a bracket.

	Rename bracket StepTypes to use consistent naming

Possible Bugs:
	Will a Jump with NewArrow NewArrow include UD to DU?
	Currently, JumpBothSame after a FootSwap will cause both feet to jump on the same arrow.
		Not true. This jump will fail to be made since each foot's other foot is resting on the arrow. 

Tests:
	Foot swap mine indication on wrong mine.
	Jump v Bracket
		JumpBothSame
		JumpBothNew
		Jump
	Chords / Quad

Bugs:
	Misc Bugs:
		sm reader strips spaces out of some text like "Chief Skittles"
	Chart Bugs:
		Don't You Want Me:
			45: the intent here is a mine indicated double step, but if you ignore the mine the program did it better
		Giga Violate:
			14, Should be a bracket AND a foot swap and NOT a jump.
		Echidna:
			7: Supposed to be swap instead of 3 jack?
				same in 11, 13, 21
			61: mine indicated foot swaps - questionable

Misc:
	SSC file parsing / saving
	Write some code to export lines of code that can be used to unit test the expression.
		This way you can easily make tests for entire charts.
	Options so the user can specify which types of steps are okay to replace with which other types (brackets)

PerformedChart improvements:
	Preference:
		Swaps that don't make you move so much (e.g. got a swap that is P1D, P2L, P2L, P2R (OOF))
		Preference for closer steps (e.g. RLR as 523 is less preferable than RLR as 524)
		Move to other side more
			maybe parse a bunch of good charts, find what a good distribution looks like and try to match that.
	Choosing bad patterns:
		Going into a nebulous jump when the original chart did not.
		On a NewArrow NewArrow jump we might choose NewArrow FootSwap - feels bad
			e.g. on DP from R on P2D, L on P2U a NewArrow NewArrow jump went to L on P1R, R on P2U. P2U is a swap and this looks wrong.
		Maybe:
			Don't choose patterns that wouldn't be expressed the same way.
				This gets pretty difficult (need to be able to parse a DP pattern)

Perf:
	StepGraph generation:
		X Remove the loops over currentIndex and newIndex. This is a holdover from when the state representation was
			every arrow instead of the two arrows for each foot. We don't need to loop and can instead just check the current state's current arrows.
		X Store some bit of data per StepType that specifies its valid FootActions to remove the early out on Release types for so many methods.
		X Perhaps, same type of thing but the data specifies whether the step needs to be on a new arrow or on the same arrow
		X Remove Rolls
		Multithreaded StepGraph internals?
		Save/Load?





how do patterns? like 123412341234...
	Separate structure in Expressed charts that map a range of stepevents to another range.
		ranges that are longer (e.g. a repeated 16 note pattern) are more important to repeat

look at Hella Deep in Technical Showcase 4 - crazy bpm stuff
	scc file
	B - background change
	#SCROLLS
	#SPEEDS
NewAlone has roll chord
Primitive Vides - LR hold, alternate jacks on down
